# Library Management System

## Description

This is a Library Management system where different types of users can perform different actions. The system is connected to a book database where the information will be accessed from. 
The Librarian is the main user, being able to search, retrieve, add, and remove books from the database, as well as being able to borrow books for another user. Students are the base user, 
being able to search and borrow books. We added a third user called admin, with the highest privilege to be able to perform all the actions that students and librarians can do, as well as adding 
and removing users in the system. Each user type logs in with their credentials and interacts with a menu, designed to show only the actions available to their role.

- Java: Core programming language.
